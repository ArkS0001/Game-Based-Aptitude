Marking: (PrepInsta’s Secret Sauce)

    Everytime you solve a problem correctly you level up.
    In each level the difficulty of the problem increases.
    To reward users, each level has a higher marking scheme as given below –
    We are testing users, visual reasoning, decoding, problem solving skills
    The above test is ideal for jobs that require solving complex problems : Engineers, Finance, Accounts, HR, Software etc

Marking Scheme

    Level Rewards = (Current-Level)2/(Time taken at Level)
    Total Rewards = Σ (Rewards at each  level)
